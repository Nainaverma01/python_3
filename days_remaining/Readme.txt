I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realized just how little time we actually have.

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
:::::::::::::::::::::::Hint:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
1.There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
2.Try copying the example output into your code and replacing the relevant parts so that the sentence is formatted the same way.

:::::::::::::::::::::Example Output:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
